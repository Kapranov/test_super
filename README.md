# TestSuper - Robust compute for RDF queries

**TODO: Add description**

Let's lay out an outline for the project:

1. We'll initially create the project.
2. We'll then implement a `GenServer`, show some callbacks and a public
   interface for those.
3. We'll next demo the `GenServer` as a basic key/value store.
4. We'll then add SPARQL queries into the mix using `SPARQL.Client` and
   save our results into a `GenServer`.
5. Next we'll put a `GenServer` under a static supervision tree and show
   how it is automatically restarted when it errors.
6. And lastly we'll create `GenServer` processes dynamically.

## Create the project

```bash
mkdir test_super; cd test_super

mix new . --sup
```
